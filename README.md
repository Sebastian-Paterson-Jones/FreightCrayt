Android collection application for managing collectables.

## Open Source Coding
We are creating this application for a project in our third year of university.
You will be able to sign up and login to your account and view your collectables.
You will also be able to add more collectables, view other users collections and share your collections.

## How to Start Project
You have to have Android Studio installed, the latest version is recommended (Chipmunk 2021.2.1 Patch 1 or Electric Eel 2022.1.1 Canary 2)
Once the project is open in your Android Studio you will need to have an emulator downloaded with an Android API Level of 24 and above.
You create the emulator in the Device Manager Tab, choose the phone and download the selected API level.
You can then run the app on this emulator by clicking on the green triangle (Run 'app') or by clicking shift + F10.
This will build the app and run your emulator.

## What to expect in the app
Once the emulator is running and the app is built you will be presented with a Login and Register screen.
