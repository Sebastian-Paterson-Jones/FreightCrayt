# FreightCrayt
Android collection application for managing collectables.

## Open Source Coding
We are creating this application for a project in our third year of university.
You will be able to sign up and login to your account and view your collectables.
You will also be able to add more collectables, view other users collections and share your collections.

## How to Start Project
You have to have Android Studio installed, the latest version is recommended (Chipmunk 2021.2.1 Patch 1 or Electric Eel 2022.1.1 Canary 2)
Once the project is open in your Android Studio you will need to have an emulator downloaded with an Android API Level of 24 and above.
You create the emulator in the Device Manager Tab, choose the phone and download the selected API level.
You can then run the app on this emulator by clicking on the green triangle (Run 'app') or by clicking shift + F10.
This will build the app and run your emulator.

## What to expect in the app
Once the emulator is running and the app is built you will be presented with a Login and Register screen.
You will have the option to either login or join, depending on if you have an existing account or not.
Once you create an account, click the "Login" button, and you will be redirected to the Crayts page.
On this page you will either have the option to collaborate with other users, or to manage your own personal crayts and items.
You will be able to share, edit and delete your crates by clicking on the respective icons.
On the bottom right of this screen, will be a user icon, which will direct you to the User Account Screen.
This screen will show you the total amount of crayts and items you have. You can update, delete crayts/items and sign out from this screen.
Clicking on the "Add" button (green cross at the bottom-middle of the screen), will give you options to either add a new crayt or item.
If you click "Add new crayt" you will be taken to another screen where you can enter a Category Name, Goal and description for a crayt.
By clicking Add New, your new crayt will be added to your collection, and by clicking discard, no crayts will be added.
If you click "Add new item" you will be taken to another screen where you can enter an Item Title, Date of Acquisition, Category, and description. 
You will also be able to add an image by clicking on the pencil icon at the bottom right of the camera icon.
At the bottom of all the pages you will find three buttons. The three lines on the bottom left will direct you to the Crayts page.
The middle "Add" button will give you options to either add a new crayt or item.
The user icon button will allow you to sign out, and view and alter information on your collections.
